# Speed indicator for windows 11

This project aims to provide a simple, always-visible network speed indicator for Windows.

No heavy dashboards, no unnecessary features — just real-time speed in the system tray.

Built to stay lightweight, reliable, and easy to extend.

Because basic visibility shouldn’t require complex tools.

Cheers 🍻🍻

## DEMO

It creates 2 taskbar icons, one for speed (see yellow arrow) and another for unit (see red arrow)
